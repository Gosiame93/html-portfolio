<h1>About Me</h1>

  support studios both Radio and Tv studios to make sure they are always ready and in working conditions. And sometimes i am sent out on

  Recently i have been made responsible of the technical store rooms to keep track of equipment ins and outs and repair any reported broken 
  equipment. In short i do alot at the SABC, sometimes things that are out of my job responsibilities simply because i can help and i 
  am a very curious individual.
